	<h1>What is Docker</h1>
  <p>
    Docker is a platform that allows developers to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. Containers package an application and its dependencies, ensuring that it runs consistently across different environments. This makes Docker especially valuable for developing, testing, and deploying software in a streamlined way, as the "containerized" app works the same on a developer's local machine as it does on production servers. Docker also supports microservices architecture by isolating services, making applications more scalable and easier to manage.
